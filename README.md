# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

A software and frontend developer from **Dominican Republic**. ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡´

Since I was 14 years old I have been passionate about software development, especially web development. I am currently contributing to Open Source projects, working on an educational application and open to new opportunities.

I have the necessary experience and resources to work and/or collaborate in any remote development team.
